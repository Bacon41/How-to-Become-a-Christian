<h1>Meeting God's People</h1>
<h2>The First Church (when the apostles lived)</h2>
<p class="scripture">Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common. And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all. Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles' feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need. </p>
<p class="scriptref">(Acts 4:32-35)<p class="scriptref">
<h2>A New People&mdash;A People of God</h2>
<p>Being a Christian means being part of a "new people" (Ephesians 2:15, 2 Corinthians 5:17). We are introduced to the "household of God" (Ephesians 2:19). And we have brothers and sisters in the faith. This means that something wonderful and supernatural can happen when believers gather together. The Holy Spirit dwells in the midst of God's people making it a "temple of the Holy Spirit." <span class="scripture">"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple" (1 Corinthians 3:16-17).</span> These verses indicate that there are very severe consequences for people who disrupt or harm God's people&mdash;the church.</p>
<p>God uses different Christians in different ways. Some are powerful preachers. Others can help the poor. Others are very good at praying while another person may possess gifts of leadership and administration (1 Corinthians 12:1-11). We are like the parts of a body&mdash;some are "legs," others "ears," others "eyes" and so on. The Bible sometimes calls the church "the body of Christ." We are the visible, on-this-earth representation of Jesus Christ. If Jesus wants to care for someone He will use a part of "His body" to do it. You and I thus have important functions in this world. We are not to be jealous or envious of one another, but to build one another up in love. Just as in our human body the arms are connected to the head, etc., we are to be a team. Much hurt can come when Christians compete with one another. This is absolutely wrong, we are to <span class="scripture">"maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3).</span></p>
<h2>A Good Church</h2>
<p>When you look for a church, check to see that it has the following four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound biblical preaching that lifts up Jesus Christ as Savior, Lord, and God. </li>
<li>Humble, godly, and wise leadership. ("Red flag" attitudes include: greed, pride, moral looseness, and disrespect.) </li>
<li>The people of the church clearly love one another. </li>
<li>There is holiness and clear standards of right and wrong. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unsure about a church then talk to some wise Christians that you know and ask their opinion of it. Or email me at <a href="mailto:h2bac@gmx.com">h2bac@gmx.com</a>. I will not favor one particular denomination over another, but seek to give you sound principles and advice. </p>
 
<h2>A Bad Church</h2>
<p>There are some groups you need to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid groups that claim their particular group is the only group that will enter the Kingdom of God. They are often full of unsound teaching and manipulative practices.</li>
<li>Avoid groups that refuse to be upfront with you on the first meeting. </li>
<li>Avoid groups that are centered around a particular human leader who is often made out to be an infallible guide. Particularly if they ask for large sums of money. </li>
<li>Avoid groups that do not see Jesus as the only way to salvation. </li>
<li>Avoid groups which mix together Christianity and other religions. </li>
<li>Avoid groups which have "unique teachings" about Jesus. </li>
<li>Avoid groups that participate in the occult or which condone some forms of immorality. </li>
<li>Avoid groups that have "their own version" of the Scriptures or which add to the Bible. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Loving the Church</h2>
<p>There are no perfect churches. Once you have found a good church, stick with it despite the ups and downs. Churches are full of people like you who make mistakes, aren't perfect, and say things they do not really mean. One day someone may say or do something that really hurts you. Stick with it and don't get bitter towards all Christians because of the foolishness of a few. Remember some people who attend church are not really born again. Some are still searching, some are pretending, but the vast majority are really nice people. </p>
<p>Here are three things you should take to church each Sunday:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Your heart to be filled with the Spirit</b>&mdash;Go with an open and expectant attitude and you will receive. </li>
<li><b>Your eyes and your hands</b>&mdash;Watch for the needs of the people of God and meet them in practical ways. </li> 
<li><b>Your mind</b>&mdash;Be ready to hear, understand, and think about God's word. Some Christians think that faith and their minds cannot mix. That is wrong. It is true that faith and a puffed up and arrogant mind cannot mix. But faith and an <i>inquiring mind</i> go hand in hand and create wisdom, knowledge, grace, and truth. </li>
</ul>
