<h1>Loving Your Neighbor</h1>
<h2>The Story of the Good Samaritan</h2>
<p class="scripture">And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?" And he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself." And he said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live."<br />
But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?" He said, "The one who showed him mercy." And Jesus said to him, "You go, and do likewise."</p>

<h2>Love of Neighbor</h2>
<p>Love of God and love of neighbor are the two great commandments. They are repeated dozens of times in the Scriptures (for example, <span class="scripture">"By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth" (1 John 3:16-18).<span class="scripture">) There is a compelling weight to these exhortations. We MUST do the good works that God has prepared beforehand for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). This page is devoted to showing you how to fulfill this commandment. From the above parable, we can see that the Good Samaritan a) perceived the need, b) bothered to get involved in the mess, c) paid the price of following it through to completion, d) and did so in an open-hearted attitude full of mercy and generosity. The Good Samaritan also got on with his business and let the person recover in peace. He was not a busybody or a sanctimonious do-gooder. There is something direct and practical about him, almost businesslike. </p>
<p><b>Step One</b>&mdash;When we see a brother or sister in need we can give whatever immediate help we can from the resources we have available (and God always gives you enough to meet the need once you start using "the loaves and fishes" principle (Matthew 14:14-21). We must never ignore the need. To "close our hearts" is to squelch the love of God in us (1 John 3:17).</p>
<p><b>Step Two</b>&mdash;Refer them to someone more able to help ("the innkeeper") but be prepared to still be involved and pick up the tab if necessary. This may mean taking them to AA or Social Security and standing with them until things are sorted out.</p>
<p><b>Step Three</b>&mdash;Check our attitude. Are we being generous or are we resenting "having to get involved?" Are we merciful and gracious or do we view the person as foolish? Are we helping out in order to boost ourselves or because we had compassion on that person? We should still help even if though our motives are very mixed and pride creeps in. It is better to meet the need. This way we are keeping our hearts open to the love and mercy of God. In time, this will correct our attitudes.<p> 
<p>May I suggest a set of priorities for Christian compassion?</p>
<ol>
<li>Our spouse </li>
<li>Our children </li>
<li>Our aged parents </li>
<li>The church</li>
<li>The basic needs of the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some verses that form the basis for my order of priorities:
<p class="scripture">In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Ephesians 5:28)</p>
<p class="scripture">If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(1 Timothy 5:8)</p>
<p class="scripture">And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban"' (that is, given to God)&mdash;then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do."</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Mark 7:9-13)</p>
<p class="scripture">And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Galatians 6:9-10)</p>
From Galatians we see that "doing good" is "especially" to Christians. From Mark we see that church comes behind parents. Paul says in 1 Timothy that providing for one's family is absolutely basic to being a Christian. He says in Ephesians that spouses hold a very high place indeed&mdash;as high as our own bodies.
This is a common sense order and may help you sort out your helping role. Do not use it as an excuse though! Remember we are exhorted in Galatians to "do good to all" (Galatians 6:10).
