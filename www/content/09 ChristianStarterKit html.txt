<h1>9. What About Heaven and Hell</h1>
<h2>The Bible Describes Judgment Day</h2>
<script>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind, which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” </script>
<script.ref>(Matthew 13:47-50)</script.ref>
<script>The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</script>
<script>Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</script>

<h2>The Fixed-Up &amp; Made New World</h2>
<script>Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” <script>
<script.ref>(Revelation 21:1-4)</script.ref>
<h2>Heaven &amp; Hell</h2>
<p>God is holy and must deal with sin. Sin can be dealt by us through repentance and faith and following Jesus in the pursuit of holiness. This way of dealing with sin leads to heaven. Or sin can accumulate and “store up the wrath of God for the Day of Judgment.” People who have not dealt with their sin by repentance, faith, and following Jesus will be destroyed&amp;mdash;cast into the lake of fire. They are not deserving of, or fit for, heaven. They do not have a <a href=”http://aibi.gospelcom.net/articles/fllwup7.htm”>sinless “real self” (see the AIBI article on the Inner Man)</a>. Their real self is still sinful and wicked. Therefore, it is destroyed and punished. Hell is not a sort of debauched party full of sinners having a good time, it is unrelenting anguish without any place for or possibility of rest and relief. </p>
<p>Heaven is the absolute enjoyment of the presence and power of God. It is where God's love is perfectly understood and where absolute total blissful happiness is normal. In heaven there will be no more crying or pain. It is ended. The days of suffering, meaninglessness, misfortune and calamity are over. It is a world ordered for good and for the very best. Should you go to heaven you will dwell in unimaginable wealth&amp;mdash;yet without coveting, you will reign with Christ&amp;mdash;in humility and meekness, you will have a life that goes on for all eternity full of purpose, love, and meaning. It will be a place where every scar on your soul is healed, where every tear is forgotten and where the life of God flows through you like an ever flowing stream. (Revelation 21 &amp; 22)</p>
