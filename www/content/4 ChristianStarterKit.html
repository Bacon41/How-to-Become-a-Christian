<h1>How to Pray</h1>
<h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
<p class="scripture">And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br />
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this:</p>
<p class="indent scripture">Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.<br />
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br />
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<br />
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p class="scripture" style="margin-top: 0;">And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Matthew 6:5-18)</p>
<h2>Some Basic Truths about Prayer</h2>
<p>The passage above tells us a few very basic truths about prayer. They are that we should pray:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believing that God hears what we pray even in secret. </li>
<li>We are not to pray for public show but so as to be heard by God. </li>
<li>That we are to pray for God's honor and glory and Christian work (His Kingdom). For things to be done right on earth as they are in heaven, for our basic needs, for forgiveness and deliverance from sin. This is a balanced prayer diet that proceeds from the most important items to the less important and which starts us praying in a positive and worshipful way. </li>
<li>The Lord's Prayer can be used as a <i>backbone</i> to hang other prayers off. When you pray "Thy kingdom come." It can trigger you praying for something happening in your church, or on the mission field or the salvation of a friend. And so on with each of the sections of the Lord's Prayer triggering appropriate reflections and requests. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Where, When, and How To Pray</h2>
<p class="scripture">But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Luke 5:16)</p>
<p class="scripture">In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Hebrews 5:7)</p>
<p>When Jesus prayed it was often:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alone </li>
<li>In a quiet place </li>
<li>With deep emotion and intimate language to God who He called "Abba Father" (literally "Daddy") </li>
<li>With force and persistence </li>
<li>With holiness and godly fear</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a good pattern for you to follow. Find a quiet place, take your Bible, and pour out your heart to God as fully as you can in a godly and reverent way. The words are not that important. God understands you. Just speak in a way that is respectful and truthful and yet bold and which really asks big things of God. He is our Father and He wants children that are willing to speak what is in their heart to Him. </p>
