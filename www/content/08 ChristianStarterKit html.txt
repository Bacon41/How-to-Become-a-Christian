<h1>8. Breaking Free From Sin</h1>
<h2>We Have the Power to No Longer Live in Sin<h2>
<script>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</script>
<script>&amp;nbsp;</script>
<script>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace. </script>
<script>&amp;nbsp;</script>
<script>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness? But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered. And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness. </script>
<script>&amp;nbsp;</script>
<script>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</script>
<script.ref>(Romans 6:5-23)</script.ref>
<script>Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</script>
<script.ref>(1 John 3:9)</script.ref>
<h2>The Struggle with Sin</h2>
<p>The Bible makes clear that Christians have victory over both the penalty and power of sin. We often find it difficult to believe this because of the intense struggle we have with “sin in our members” (Romans 7, Galatians 5:16-18). First John gives us a clue on how to think about this when it says “he cannot sin because he has been born of God”&amp;mdash;who cannot sin&amp;mdash;that part of us that has been born of God and is a new creation in Christ! Christ in us is sin-free&amp;mdash;as sinless as he was here on earth! When we die and God takes us to heaven then we will not sin any more. The part of us that lasts forever is free from sin. In fact, it is so completely unresponsive to sin that it can be said to be “dead to sin.” Our true eternal selves are sinless.</p>
<p>This is a powerful truth that can help us live the Christian life. There are two parts of us in conflict “the flesh” which is temporary and which stops having any influence after we die or Christ returns, and the spirit which is eternal, spotless, undefiled, and holy. Hence, another name for all Christians is “saints” or “holy ones” because our true, essentials elves are holy we can be called “holy ones.” Now this battle between the flesh and the spirit can be very intense and very discouraging. In fact the apostle Paul cries out, <script.inline>“I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good” (Romans 7:21).</script.inline> This is the experience of all Christians and often makes us feel very condemned.</p>
<p>However, <b>there is a solution</b> to this problem! </p>
<script>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</script>
<script.ref>(Galatians 5:16-18)</script.ref>
<script>There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</script>
<script.ref>(Romans 8:1-6)</script.ref>
<p>The solution then is to fill your life with the things of the Spirit and to direct your mind into the things of God so that “the flesh” and its interests do not get a look in. Set your mind on the things of the Spirit and you will have life and peace. To do this you should regularly pray, read the Bible, live according to its teachings and meet with other Christians. </p>
<p>The more time you make for God&amp;mdash;the less there will be for sin and self-defeat.</p>
<p>In particular, pray for these things:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grace</b>&amp;mdash;God to be kind toward you and give you many undeserved favors and the power to resist sin. </li>
<li><b>Mercy</b>&amp;mdash;For God to deliver you from the messes you get yourself into especially when we are ignorant/foolish. </li>
<li><b>Peace</b>&amp;mdash;The integration of your life under the blessings of God so that sin has no foothold in you. </li>
<li><b>Understanding</b>&amp;mdash;Of what God has done for in Christ and the power over sin that is within you. </li>
<li><b>Wisdom &amp; Discernment</b>&amp;mdash;So you can apply your understanding to real life situations. </li>
<li><b>To Be Filled with the Love of God</b>&amp;mdash;Which takes over our hearts and makes thinking spiritual thoughts easy. </li>
<li><b>To Be Filled with the Spirit</b>&amp;mdash;And able to see and perceive the things of God so that we are bold and joyful. </li>
