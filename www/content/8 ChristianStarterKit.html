<h1>Breaking Free From Sin</h1>
<h2>We Have the Power to No Longer Live in Sin</h2>
<p class="scripture">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<br />
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.<br />
What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.<br />
For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Romans 6:5-23)</p>
<p class="scripture">No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(1 John 3:9)</p>
<h2>The Struggle with Sin</h2>
<p>The Bible makes clear that Christians have victory over both the penalty and power of sin. We often find it difficult to believe this because of the intense struggle we have with "sin in our members" (Romans 7, Galatians 5:16-18). John gives us a clue on how to think about this when he says, <span class="scripture">"he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God" (1 John 3:9b)</span>. That part of us has been born of God and is a new creation in Christ! Christ in us is sin-free&mdash;as sinless as he was here on earth! When we die and God takes us to heaven then we will not sin any more. The part of us that lasts forever is free from sin. In fact, it is so completely unresponsive to sin that it can be said to be "dead to sin." Our true eternal selves are sinless.</p>
<p>This is a powerful truth that can help us live the Christian life. There are two parts of us in conflict "the flesh" which is temporary and which stops having any influence after we die or Christ returns, and the spirit which is eternal, spotless, clean, and holy. Hence, another name for all Christians is "saints" or "holy ones" because our true, essentials selves are holy we can be called "holy ones." Now this battle between the flesh and the spirit can be very intense and very discouraging. In fact, the apostle Paul cries out, <span class="scripture">"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand." (Romans 7:21).</span> This is the experience of all Christians and often makes us feel very condemned.</p>
<p>However, <b>there is a solution</b> to this problem! </p>
<p class="scripture">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Galatians 5:16-18)</p>
<p class="scripture">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Romans 8:1-6)</p>
<p>The solution is to fill your life with the things of the Spirit and to direct your mind to the things of God so that "the flesh" and its interests do not get a look in. Set your mind on the things of the Spirit and you will have life and peace. To do this you should regularly pray, read the Bible, live according to its teachings, and meet with other Christians. </p>
<p>The more time you make for God, the less there will be for sin and self-defeat.</p>
<p>In particular, pray for these things:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grace</b>&mdash;God to be kind toward you and give you many undeserved favors and the power to resist sin. </li>
<li><b>Mercy</b>&mdash;For God to deliver you from the messes you get yourself into, especially when we are ignorant/foolish. </li>
<li><b>Peace</b>&mdash;The integration of your life under the blessings of God so that sin has no foothold in you. </li>
<li><b>Understanding</b>&mdash;Of what God has done for you in Christ and the power over sin that is within you. </li>
<li><b>Wisdom &amp; Discernment</b>&mdash;So you can apply your understanding to real life situations. </li>
<li><b>To Be Filled with the Love of God</b>&mdash;Which takes over our hearts and makes thinking spiritual thoughts easy. </li>
<li><b>To Be Filled with the Spirit</b>&mdash;Able to see and perceive the things of God so that we are bold and joyful. </li>

</ul>
