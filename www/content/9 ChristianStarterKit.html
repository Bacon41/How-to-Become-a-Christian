<h1>What About Heaven and Hell</h1>
<h2>The Bible Describes Judgment Day</h2>
<p class="scripture">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p class="scriptref">(Matthew 13:47-50)</p>
<p class="scripture">The devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br />
Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Revelation 20:10-15)</p>
<h2>The Fixed-Up &amp; Made New World</h2>
<p class="scripture">Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Revelation 21:1-4)</p>
<h2>Heaven &amp; Hell</h2>
<p>God is holy and must deal with sin. Sin can be dealt by us through repentance and faith and following Jesus in the pursuit of holiness. This way of dealing with sin leads to heaven. Or sin can accumulate and "store up the wrath of God for the Day of Judgment." People who have not dealt with their sin by repentance, faith, and following Jesus will be destroyed&mdash;cast into the lake of fire. They are not deserving of, or fit for, heaven. They do not have a <a href="" onclick="permenantStorage.setItem('page', 8); changePage();">sinless "real self" (see the AIBI article on the Inner Man)</a>. Their real self is still sinful and wicked. Therefore, it is destroyed and punished. Hell is not a sort of debauched party full of sinners having a good time, it is unrelenting anguish without any rest or relief. </p>
<p>Heaven is the absolute enjoyment of the presence and power of God. It is where God's love is perfectly understood and where absolute total blissful happiness is normal. In heaven there will be no more crying or pain. It is ended. The days of suffering, meaninglessness, misfortune, and calamity are over. It is a world ordered for good and for the very best. Should you go to heaven you will dwell in unimaginable wealth&mdash;yet without coveting, you will reign with Christ in humility and meekness. You will have a life that goes on for all eternity full of purpose, love, and meaning. It will be a place where every scar on your soul is healed, where every tear is forgotten, and where the life of God flows through you like an ever flowing stream (Revelation 21 &amp; 22).</p>
