<h1>What Is God Like?</h1>
<h2>How the Bible Describes God</h2>
<p class="scripture">Lord, you have been our dwelling place</p>
<p class="scripture">in all generations.</p>
<p class="scripture">Before the mountains were brought forth,</p>
<p class="scripture">or ever you had formed the earth and the world,</p>
<p class="scripture">from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Psalms 90:1-2)</p>
<p class="scripture">The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Exodus 34:6-7)</p>
<p class="scripture">In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:</p>
<p class="indent scripture">"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;</p>
<p class="indent scripture">the whole earth is full of his glory!"</p>
<p class="scripture">And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Isaiah 6:1-4)</p>
<p>These are just some of the descriptions of God in the Bible. They tell us that God is everlasting and unchanging. That He is merciful, kind, gracious, just, and faithful. He is holy and without sin. He is abounding in goodness and truth. He is a God we can trust utterly.</p>
<h2>God Is Like Jesus</h2>
<p>Above all God is like Jesus. Jesus is the "perfect image" of God. Jesus came to show us exactly what God is like: </p>
<p class="scripture">Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? </p>
<p class="scriptref">(John 14:9b-10a)</p>
<p class="scripture">Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(Hebrews 1:1-3)</p>
<p class="scripture">No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.</p>
<p class="scriptref">(John 1:18)</p>
<p>Jesus is kind because God is kind. Jesus healed people because God likes to heal people. Jesus liked the poor because God likes the poor. Jesus taught the truth because God is Truth. Jesus was sinless because God is sinless and Jesus taught with authority because God is God. Jesus tells us what God is like but as an "image" as a small scale representation that we can understand. Jesus, though He was God, did not hurl galaxies around while He was on earth. He became like God at a human level. Jesus is our clearest signpost to what God is like. Jesus was uncompromising yet merciful, kind yet full of truth, wise yet humble. He always acted in love because God always acts in love and freedom. He is utterly free and wishes us to be free also. </p>
<p>Jesus used His great power to heal and help others. God also wants to use His great power to heal and help you. If you have prayed to receive Jesus Christ into your life and if you have submitted your life to Him then God's power is in you. Jesus Christ and all His power, resources, and love has come to dwell in you. You have a huge power source right in the middle of your life. Call out to God and ask Him now to help you, to heal you and to show you how much power and love He has put inside you so you can continue to walk with Him.</p>
