<h1>5. What Is God Like?</h1>
<h2>How the Bible Describes God</h2>
<script>Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations. </script>
<script>Before the mountains were brought forth, </script>
<script>Or ever You had formed the earth and the world, </script>
<script>Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God. </script>
<script.ref>(Psalms 90:1-2)</script.ref>
<script>And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.” </script>
<script.ref>(Exodus 34:6-7)</script.ref>
<script>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one cried to another and said: </script>
<script.indent> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; </script.indent>
<script.indent>The whole earth is full of His glory!” </script.indent>
<script>And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke. </script>
<script.ref>(Isaiah 6:1-4)</script.ref>
<p>These are just some of the descriptions of God in the Bible. They tell us that God is everlasting and unchanging, that He is merciful, kind and gracious, that He is just and faithful, that He is holy and without sin. He is abounding in goodness and truth. He is a God we can trust utterly.</p>
<h2>God Is Like Jesus</h2>
<p>Above all God is like Jesus. Jesus is the “perfect image” of God. Jesus came to show us exactly what God is like: </p>
<script>“Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?” </script>
<script.ref>(John 14:9b-10a)</script.ref>
<script>“God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high”</script>
<script.ref>(Hebrews 1:1-3)</script.ref>
<script>“No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him”</script>
<script.ref>(John 1:18)</script.ref>
<p>Jesus is kind because God is kind. Jesus healed people because God likes to heal people. Jesus liked the poor because God likes the poor. Jesus taught the truth because God is Truth. Jesus was sinless because God id sinless and Jesus taught with authority because God is God. Jesus tells us what God is like but as an “image” as a small scale representation that we can understand. Jesus, though He was God, did not hurl galaxies around while He was on earth. He became like God at a human level. Jesus is our clearest signpost to what God is like. Jesus was uncompromising yet merciful, kind yet full of truth, wise yet humble. He always acted in love because God always acts in love and freedom .He is utterly free and wishes us to be free also. </p>
<p>Jesus used His great power to heal and help others. God also wants to use His great power to heal and help you. If you have prayed to receive Jesus Christ into your life and if you have submitted your life to Him the God's power is in you. Jesus Christ and all His power, resources and love has come to dwell in you. You have a huge power source right in the middle of your life. Call out to God and ask Him now to help you, to heal you and to show you how much power and love He has put inside you so you can continue to walk with Him.</p>
